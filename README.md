# Tic Tac Toe (Group project for Agile Web Development CITS5505)
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game that is simple yet challenging, often played on paper but also available in digital forms. In our project we allow user to creat their own account inorder to track their stats. Meanwhile it is quite easy for different users to create a new Tic Tac Toe Page against each other.
## Installation and Setup

This guide assumes that you have python installed.
### Step 1 - Setup/Launch Virtual Environment

If this is the first usage, create a virtual environment

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

Then launch the virtual environment

```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate 
```

From within the virtual environment, install project requirements from requirements.txt

```bash
(venv) $ sudo apt-get update
(venv) $ sudo apt-get upgrade
(venv) $ sudo apt install pip
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


1. The purpose of this application was to create a Tic Tac Toe Page where users could play against each other and track their stats!

2. The application can be launched using python run.py and a secret key can be specified using terminal set commands.
